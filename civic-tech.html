            <h2>Baltimore City Digital Services</h2>
        </a>
        <p>As the founding Director of Digital Services for the City of Baltimore, I built a cross-functional team of senior level technologists working in the Mayor's Office to deliver high-quality products and services to Baltimore residents by focusing on people, technology, and outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Civic Unrest</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Civic Unrest is a blog focused on the intersection of technology and public infrastructure. It's a pretty broad topic, and I'm okay with that.</p>

            <h2>Justice40: Screening Tool and Open Source Community</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Justice40 is a whole-of-government initiative to address historic issues of environmental, economic, and climate injustice by redirecting 40% of federal benefits to overburdened and underserved communities. As part of my work at USDS, I served as the tech lead and engineering manager for the team building the Justice40 Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool and fostered the open source community around this tool and related tech+data efforts to advance environmental justice causes.</p>

            <h2>Pandemic-Ready Interoperable Modernization Effort (PRIME) @ CDC</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Born out of a discovery sprint to identify problems with the COVID data pipeline from communities to federal government, PRIME's goal is to build modern, interoperable, pandemic-ready public health IT systems that are open source and modular. I was on the original discovery sprint and helped develop the roadmap and strategy for PRIME. I served as the tech lead for the Data Automation project, which aimed to improve the flow of hospitalization and capacity data as well as COVID test and case data from healthcare providers to local and state authorities.</p>

        </a>
        <p>Data at the Point of Care is an API that gets bulk Medicare claims data directly into the hands of providers so that they can make more informed decisions about their their patients' care. I joined this team as part of my work at USDS at CMS. 2019-2020.</p>

            <h2>Open Referral</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            Open Referral develops data standards and open source tools that make it easier to share, find and use information about health, human, and social services. I helped build data tooling and APIs for community implementations of Open Referral's Human Services Data and API Specifications, including working on open source Ruby tooling to support <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io/" target="_blank">Frictionless Data</a>'s <a href="https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/" target="_blank">Data Package</a> spec. 2019.

            <h2>REST Fest</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            REST Fest is an international unconference series dedicated to giving people interested in REST, Hypermedia APIs, crafting web service APIs, or any related topics a chance to get together in an informal setting to share ideas, trade stories, and show examples of current work. I help organize and implement these events and expand them to new locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: REST Fest is going on a hiatus in 2020-21, though we may do some virtual community events.
