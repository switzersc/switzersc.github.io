        <p class="excerpt">
            I am a core team member of Code for Denver, a Code for America brigade. Along with helping to organize meetings and projects, I regularly participate in roles such as meeting facilitator, product owner, and developer. Our projects this year have focused on creating tech solutions for local nonprofits' problems through various technologies like ReactJS, Ruby, Salesforce, Clojure, and Drupal. codefordenver.org

        <p class="excerpt">
            API-in-a-Box was inspired by my work with Code for Atlanta and a particular project called show-me-the-food, which aimed to document and provide tooling around canvassing food deserts in Atlanta. It is an open-source, containerized hypermedia approach to building and using APIs for open data.  github.com/switzersc/api-in-a-box
