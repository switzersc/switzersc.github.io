<h1>Hi there! I'm Shelby.</h1>

<p>
    I'm a writer and civic technologist currently based in Baltimore, MD, USA.
</p>

<p>
    I write short stories and novels.
</p>
<p>
    I also occasionally write about the intersection of society, technology, and infrastructure on my blog, <a href="https://civicunrest.com" target="_blank">Civic Unrest</a>.
</p>


<p>
    I don't social media much, but you can follow me on <a href="https://universeodon.com/@civicunrest" target="_blank">Mastadon</a>. You can find my code on Github as <a href="https://github.com/switzersc/" target="_blank">switzersc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/switzersc-usds" target="_blank">switzersc-usds</a>.
