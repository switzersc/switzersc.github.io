<h1>Hi there! I'm Shelby.</h1>

<p>
    I'm a writer and civic technologist currently based in Washington, DC. I have a background in software development and API design and strategy, most recently in healthcare technology. Throughout my career I have focused on open data, open standards, civic/social/public tech, and civic hacktivism.
</p>

<p>
    I spend most of my day working as a software engineer with the <a href="https://usds.gov" target="_blank">US Digital Service</a> at the Department of Health and Human Services, primarily at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). When not working on API and data strategy in government, I spend most of my time on research I find interesting or impactful, contributing to open source or open standards projects, and writing about the intersection of technology, society, and public infrastructure.

            <h2>REST Fest</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            REST Fest is an international unconference series dedicated to giving people interested in REST, Hypermedia APIs, crafting web service APIs, or any related topics a chance to get together in an informal setting to share ideas, trade stories, and show examples of current work. I help organize and implement these events and expand them to new locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: REST Fest is going on a hiatus in 2020, though we may be doing some virtual community events.

            Open Referral develops data standards and open source tools that make it easier to share, find and use information about health, human, and social services. I helped build data tooling and APIs for community implementations of Open Referral's Human Services Data and API Specifications, including working on open source Ruby tooling to support <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io/" target="_blank">Frictionless Data</a>'s <a href="https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/" target="_blank">Data Package</a> spec. 2019.
