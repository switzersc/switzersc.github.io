<h1>Hi there! I'm Shelby.</h1>

<p>
    I'm a writer and civic technologist currently based in New York City. I have a background in software development and API design and strategy across a number of domains. Throughout my career I have focused on open data, open standards, civic/social/public tech, and civic hacktivism.
</p>

<p>
    These days I spend most of my time on research I find interesting or impactful, contributing to open source or open standards projects, and writing about the intersection of technology, society, and public infrastructure. You can find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly" target="_blank">@switzerly</a> or on Github as <a href="https://github.com/switzersc/" target="_blank">switzersc</a>.

            <h2>Civic Unrest</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Civic Unrest is a blog focused on the intersection of technology and public infrastructure. It's a pretty broad topic, and I'm okay with that.</p>

            <h2>REST Fest</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
            REST Fest is an international unconference series dedicated to giving people interested in REST, Hypermedia APIs, crafting web service APIs, or any related topics a chance to get together in an informal setting to share ideas, trade stories, and show examples of current work. I help organize and implement these events and expand them to new locations.
